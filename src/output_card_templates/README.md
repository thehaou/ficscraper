This directory houses the HTML templates and CSS style sheets used to generate `ficscraper`'s year-in-review cards.

Please note that the HTML has Python mixed into it. 
This is because `ficscraper` is using [Mako templating](https://www.makotemplates.org/) in order to programmatically modify the HTML as needed.

I am not very experienced in CSS or HTML, but I am trying to learn how to be better. 
Like the rest of this repo, any mistakes / bad practices you see here are entirely my own fault.
If you see something that could be better, give me a shout! I'll try to make it better.

Also give a shout (or submit a pull request) if you'd like to contribute cool templates of your own for `ficscraper` to use : )
