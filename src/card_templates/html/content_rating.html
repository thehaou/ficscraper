<!--
For this one - I'm imagining slightly-tilted boxes (five of them), decreasing in size,
with each size based on %s. (There should be a base size though.) For ex:

E - 50%
M - 40%
T - 6%
G - 2%
NR - 2%

should have T/G/NR much smaller, as opposed to something like

T - 30%
G - 25%
M - 25%
E - 15%
NR - 5%

which should still have decreasing box sizes, but not as much.
